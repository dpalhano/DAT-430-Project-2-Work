Project involved working on analysis and some modeling which were then presented as a report and a powerpoint presentation as well. Much of the work was to create a hypothesis on why the pseudo company's attrition was so high. I chose to explore company incentives such as stock options, the employees time within the company, and the job satisfaction that was reported overall across the company as well. The purpose of the project was to aid in guiding stakeholders and management to make decisions towards decreasing attrition across all departments and levels.
